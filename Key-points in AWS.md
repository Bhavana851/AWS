#1. What is AWS?

Answer: AWS is a cloud computing platform offering a variety of services such as computing power, storage, and databases.
Explain the key components of AWS.

Answer: Key components include EC2, S3, VPC, RDS, Lambda, among others.
What is EC2 and how does it work?

Answer: EC2 provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud through virtual servers called instances.
Describe S3 and its use cases.

Answer: S3 is object storage for data storage, backup, and hosting static website content.
What is the difference between RDS and DynamoDB?

Answer: RDS is a relational database service, while DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service with seamless scalability.
Explain the concept of Auto Scaling.

Answer: Auto Scaling adjusts the number of instances based on demand, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency.
What is the significance of VPC in AWS?

Answer: VPC provides a logically isolated section of AWS Cloud, allowing users to launch resources in a controlled virtual network.
How does CloudFormation work?

Answer: CloudFormation allows users to define and provision AWS resources through infrastructure as code templates.
What is IAM and how is it used in AWS?

Answer: IAM is AWS's Identity and Access Management service, providing controls for user authentication and authorization.
Explain the difference between horizontal and vertical scaling.

Answer: Horizontal scaling adds instances for load distribution, while vertical scaling increases the capacity of a single instance.
What is AWS Lambda, and when would you use it?

Answer: AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service. It's used for executing code in response to events without provisioning or managing servers.
Discuss the importance of security groups in AWS.

Answer: Security groups control inbound and outbound traffic to AWS instances, acting as virtual firewalls.
Explain the purpose of Elastic Load Balancing.

Answer: Elastic Load Balancing distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, improving availability and fault tolerance.
What is Route 53 and what is its role in AWS?

Answer: Route 53 is AWS's scalable and highly available domain name system (DNS) web service, managing domain names and routing internet traffic.
Describe the differences between on-demand instances, reserved instances, and spot instances in EC2.

Answer: On-demand instances are pay-as-you-go, reserved instances offer cost savings with upfront commitment, and spot instances are spare capacity at a lower price.
How does AWS handle disaster recovery?

Answer: AWS offers services like Amazon S3 for backup, AWS Backup, and multi-region architecture to enhance disaster recovery capabilities.
Explain the Shared Responsibility Model in AWS security.

Answer: The model defines responsibilities: AWS manages security "of" the cloud, users manage security "in" the cloud.
What is the AWS Well-Architected Framework?

Answer: A set of best practices for building secure, efficient, and cost-effective architectures in the cloud.
Discuss the significance of CloudWatch in AWS.

Answer: CloudWatch is a monitoring service tracking AWS resources and applications, providing data and actionable insights.
What are the benefits of using AWS CloudFormation?

Answer: AWS CloudFormation allows the provisioning and management of AWS infrastructure as code, enhancing consistency and scalability.
